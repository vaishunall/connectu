# Inspiration

Our inspiration for this web application comes from our gratefulness to give back to the STEM community, and to give those who may not have the same educational experience/opportunities as us the chance to experience the same.

# What it does

ConnectU aspires to create a community initiative between High Schools/Colleges and willing Sponsors to connect and invest in opportunities that help underprivileged communities. The application allows student organizations (such as the National Honor Society, ACM, SWE) to "post" workshops/initiatives that increase outreach/assistance to the community, and interested Sponsors (such as companies or non-profits), can express interest and join hands with student organizations to make positive initiatives come to fruition.

# How we built it

Our web application is built with React.js on the front end, and Node.js+Express.js+MongoDB on the back end.

# Challenges we ran into

A challenge our team ran into was making our idea as easy to use as possible while maintaining a balance to inspire student organizations and sponsors alike to use our application.

Aside from that, some technical challenges we faced were designing an effective user interface and merging back-end and front-end functionalities.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

Learning technological stacks and experimenting with a minimalist, yet jubilant design.

# What we learned

Garner opinions! : Ask other people strengths/weaknesses of your idea. Contemplate and evaluate the pros and cons of different approaches and weigh them out carefully.

Stay persistent: Errors are integral to any coding experience, but working through them requires patience and continuity.

# What's next for ConnectU
Filter opportunities/initiatives by location
Implement an in-app chat feature to have sponsors and student organizations communicate directly through the app.
